CodeTag

Installation
============

This module requires the core CKEditor module and the CodeTag plugin from CKEditor.com.

1. Download the CodeTag plugin from http://ckeditor.com/addon/codeTag
2. Place the plugin folder in the root libraries folder (/libraries/codeTag).
3. Enable CodeTag in the Drupal admin.
4. Configure your WYSIWYG toolbar to include the button.

Basic Usage
===========

Drag the CodeTag button into the active toolbar.  There is no configuration; the button should appear in your editor after you
save the changes.

Note that your filter format must support the use of the code tag under allowed tags as well, if using anything other
than Full HTML.
